# POTD Sub-Repository

## About
This section of the **My-GeeksofGeek-Solutions** repository contains my daily solutions to the **Geeks for Geeks Problem of the Day (POTD)**. These problems help enhance problem-solving skills and keep me consistent with daily coding practice.

## Repository Structure
```
POTD/
â”‚-- YYYY/
â”‚   â”‚-- MM/
â”‚      â”‚-- DD_problem_name.py
```
Each solution is organized by **year (YYYY)**, **month (MM)**, and the filename follows the format **DD_problem_name.py** to maintain clarity and easy tracking.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/My-GeeksofGeek-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `POTD/` folder.
3. Browse by year and month to find the specific problem.
4. Run the Python scripts to test the solutions.

## Consistency & Updates
I am committed to solving the **Problem of the Day** daily and keeping this repository updated with my solutions. This practice will help in improving my coding skills and staying prepared for technical interviews.
