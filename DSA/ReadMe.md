# DSA Sub-Repository

## About
This section of the **My-GeeksofGeek-Solutions** repository contains solutions to various **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems from **Geeks for Geeks**. The problems are categorized into two main sub-repositories:

- **Data Structures**: Covers implementations and problems related to various data structures.
- **Algorithms**: Focuses on algorithmic problem-solving techniques and optimizations.

Each sub-repository further categorizes problems based on difficulty levels for structured learning.

## Difficulty Levels
- **Basic**: Covers fundamental concepts such as arrays, linked lists, and basic recursion.
- **Easy**: Problems involving stacks, queues, basic sorting, and searching techniques.
- **Medium**: Includes intermediate challenges such as dynamic programming, trees, and graph traversal.
- **Advanced**: Covers complex problems including advanced graph algorithms, segment trees, and optimizations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/My-GeeksofGeek-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `DSA/` folder.
3. Choose either `Data_Structures/` or `Algorithms/`.
4. Select the appropriate difficulty level folder.
5. Run the Python scripts to test the solutions.

## Consistency & Updates
I am committed to solving DSA problems regularly to strengthen my algorithmic thinking. This sub-repository will be updated frequently with new solutions and improvements.
